# BWAS wrapper

This is a wrapper for the [BWAS library](https://github.com/weikanggong/BWAS).

To install, clone this repository, including the submodules. For example, using https:

```
and execute the following commands in a terminal and inside the folder that contains the repository:

To understand how the wrapper works, check `bwas_demo.ipynb`, which is a small demo showing how to run an analysis on a public dataset.
